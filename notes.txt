simplifying modelling assumptions

no consideration of national shift (correlated error between states)
- national shift affects everything in the same direction anyway
- average over both directions, probably negligible (test?)

model based on margin, uncertainty
- this is not real life (different elasticity districts)
- luckily chaz ws modelling on probabilities anyway, so possible he has a 
    lower elasticity, lower margin race in the same region, probable that our
    effects are minor
    
no correlated error within a state
- suburban, rural affects
- nuttycombe states that he considers this, need to model uncertainty around this
    - backtest to see the effect in 2018
    
ties
- could pick off members from the other party to protect incumbency
- lobbying could sway a couple representatives from the powerful party


172 tilt 
120 tossup

of tilt, assume tilt are 0.589 of them
- gives 66.53%

looks like state: (0.037, 12) and race: (0.075, 5) approximates 2018 data well
- statewide error 0.42 correlated with error
- isolated race error 0.90 correlated with error 
- random data more like (0.20, 0.97)
even when you get rid of small states, very similar
