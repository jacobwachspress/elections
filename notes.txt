simplifying modelling assumptions

no consideration of national shift (correlated error between states)
- national shift affects everything in the same direction anyway
- average over both directions, probably negligible (test?)

model based on margin, uncertainty
- this is not real life (different elasticity districts)
- luckily chaz ws modelling on probabilities anyway, so possible he has a 
    lower elasticity, lower margin race in the same region, probable that our
    effects are minor
